# Railway Deployment Guide for ARYA - UPDATED

## ✅ **Files Ready for Railway Deployment:**

### **Configuration Files:**
- ✅ `railway.toml` - Railway-specific configuration
- ✅ `runtime.txt` - Python version specification
- ✅ `Procfile` - Updated startup command
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - All dependencies
- ✅ `start_railway.sh` - Startup script (backup)

### **Removed:**
- ❌ `nixpacks.toml` - Removed (was causing pip error)

## 🚀 **Deploy to Railway:**

### **Step 1: Commit Changes**
```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment - remove nixpacks, add railway.toml"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Railway Setup**
1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo**
3. Select your PROAGENT repository
4. Railway will auto-detect Python

### **Step 3: Environment Variables**
Add these in Railway dashboard:
```
GOOGLE_GEMINI_KEY = your_actual_api_key
SARVAM_API_KEY = your_actual_api_key
HOST = 0.0.0.0
DEBUG = false
```

### **Step 4: Deployment**
- Railway will build using Python auto-detection
- Uses `railway.toml` for configuration
- Health check at `/health`
- Auto-restart on failure

## 🎯 **Expected Success:**
- ✅ No more "pip: command not found" error
- ✅ Python dependencies install correctly
- ✅ No cold starts (Railway keeps apps warm)
- ✅ Health monitoring active
- ✅ Fast deployment and loading

## 🔧 **If Issues Persist:**
Railway will now use automatic Python detection instead of the problematic nixpacks configuration.
